# Refresh Preview

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows to refresh preview mode without reopening the note.

It is usually useful if you have some dynamic content:

````markdown
```dataviewjs
dv.span(new Date().toString());
```
````

When you switch to the preview mode, the content is rendered once and will rerender only if you change the content of the code block or reopen the note.

The plugin adds a `Refresh Preview` button:

The plugin allows to configure auto refresh within a given time interval.
