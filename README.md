# Refresh Any View

(formerly known as `Refresh Preview`, see [Rebranding](#rebranding) section for more details)

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that allows to refresh any view without reopening it.

It is usually useful if you have some dynamic content:

````markdown
```dataviewjs
dv.span(new Date().toString());
```
````

When you switch to the preview or live preview mode, the content is rendered once and will rerender only if you change the content of the code block or reopen the note.

The plugin adds a `Refresh` button:

Also the plugin adds the `Refresh Any View: Refresh active view` command to the command palette.

The plugin allows to configure auto refresh on file change.

The plugin allows to configure auto refresh within a given time interval (it may introduce undesired UI flickering).

## Rebranding

This plugin was formerly known as `Refresh Preview`.

The plugin can now refresh any views, not only in preview mode. That's why it got a new name.

However, for the backward compatibility, the previous id `refresh-preview` is still used internally and you might find it

- in plugin folder name;
- in plugin URL;
- in [Debugging](#debugging) section;
